# IoT-NodeMCU-React-Express-
IoT project that contains ReactJS to fetch and show data and ExpressJS to handle http requests.


Let's divide project into the three parts:

- Arduino Section

- ExpressJS Section

- ReactJS Section


# Arduino Section
With NodeMCU collected datas (which are listed below) will be posted to Express server 
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Methane Value
  - Motion 

and here is our circuit(pinouts available in .ino file)

# ExpressJS Section
ExpressJS section handles incoming request from each circuit.

# ReactJS Section
ReactJS section will be available on front side of project and people will interact with UI to fetch datas or update any values on screen.
Here are some photos from React App(Also each component boxed)
